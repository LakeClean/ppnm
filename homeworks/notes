Notes on matrices:

 - Square: m=n
 - Invertible: A has an unique solution, product of A and inverse is identity
 - Triangular: Either the lower diagonal (upper triangular) or the upper diagonal (lower triangular) is zero excluding the diagonal
 - Orthogonal: A square matrix whose transpose is equal to it inverse. equally product of A and A-tranpose is identity. Also all rows and vectors are orthonormal
 - Transpose: Transpose of matrix A is the exhange of
